                <p>Our pedicure and manicure services just might change how you think about nails. With luxurious treatments that both women and men can enjoy, we provide a truly invigorating experience. And when winter hits, there's nothing more relaxing than dipping your feet in warm water and receiving a foot massage. As dedicated professionals experienced in the art of beautifying, our staff will ensure you're treated like royalty &mdash; on each and every visit.</p>
<p><strong>Special deluxe spa pedicure&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A rejuvenating aromatherapy foot masque enhanced with hydrating sea extracts, conditioning minerals and soothing botanicals. Applied to each foot then wrapped in warm towels leaving them feeling fresh, moisturized, cool and clean.</p>
<p><strong>Dry pedicure</strong></p>
<p>Not ready to get your feet wet? Our dry pedicure uses rubbing alcohol, a warm towel and file to remove dead skin and clean the feet instead of dipping them in water. The rest of the procedure is the same, and will leave your feet feeling like new.</p>
